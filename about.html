      <p>Hi, I'm Tiria. I'm learning web development and building awesome projects!</p>
  
<p>Maybe we can start by talking about my background specifically about my languages in developing:
  Funny things is that becoming a developer never closed my mind until i joined College and was introduced to it.
  It is an interesting field..First I familiarised myself with C programming then graduated to Java and a Little of Python...
  2 Years down i have "perfected" in java and mysql as Backend programming... I'm a fun of HTML & CSS and Javascript as a token..
   I'M still learning because you can't explore everything in this vast filed of programming...
    I have tried developing a Student Management System which purely uses java and integrate it with MySQL  
    It hasn't been a smooth path...but as an enthusiastic  coder i always make sure I  learn more each day
